VirtualPersistAPI Testing Notes
===

Unit and functional tests are located in the bundle /Tests directory. So: `symfony/src/VirtualPersistAPI/Bundle/VirtualPeristAPIBundle/Tests`.

Run them by installing dependencies through Composer with the --dev flag, and then `./bin/phpunit -c app`

See `.travis.yml` for continuous integration through GitHub.
