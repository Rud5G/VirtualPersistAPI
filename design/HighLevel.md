VirtualPersistAPI High Level
============================

VPA runs under a fairly standard LAMP or *AMP stack.

The target for deployment will be Pagodabox and/or OpenShift (chosen because they are free services).

Consumers use the API to query and manage their data on the system.

In the main use case, consumers will be scripts in LSL, on Second Life or OpenSim.
