Homework 9

My project is in Symfony, which has a number of debugging and metric tools built in. Here are two of them:

Symfony allows you to specify different environments in the URL. exapmle.com/app.php is the front controller, but you can specify app_dev.php for development environment, or app_test.php for testing. By default, if you specify app_dev.php, Symfony puts a debug/metrics toolbar on the page.

Debugging can also be turned on as an option without the toolbar. This gives you a header called X-Debug, with a token string you can feed back into the profiler. Grab the token and slot it into a URL like this: example.com/_profiler/[token] and you get the same profiling page.

I've tried to put some of this profiling info into a header, particularly DB metrics since this is a DB class.

I managed to modify the header if you specify ?debug=1 in the request, but Symfony's profiler remains a bit of a mystery and now it only adds a header called X-VPA-Debug with a value of 'Debuggy!'

So, to see this in action, you can do this at the command line:

curl -v -D - http://vpa.pagodabox.com/api/6d286553-59ae-409a-887d-ee75df67b834/cat/key?debug=1 -o /dev/null

You'll see the response header info, and it will contain X-VPA-Debug.

This is possible through the addDebugInfo() method I added to the API's routing controller. You can see it here:

https://github.com/paul-m/VirtualPersistAPI/blob/master/symfony/src/VirtualPersistAPI/VirtualPersistBundle/Controller/APIController.php#L35

It's not much to talk about, but it represents an end result of a lot of trying to make other things work, such as a Symfony event subscriber, and a chain of classes and decorators.

Also, logging into the database occurs here:

https://github.com/paul-m/VirtualPersistAPI/blob/master/symfony/src/VirtualPersistAPI/VirtualPersistBundle/Controller/APIController.php#L24

This can be called on the controller making a log for whichever event you'd want to log.

You can see the current logs at /logs: http://vpa.pagodabox.com/logs
